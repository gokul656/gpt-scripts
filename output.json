        "answer": "The mean of the data set is 32.",
        "values": "",
        "hints": "To find the mean (average) of a data set, you add up all the numbers in the set and then divide by the number of items in the set. For this data set, add up all the numbers and divide by the number of items. The answer will be the mean of the data set."

        "question": "A clock runs 3 minutes fast per hour. If you set the clock to the correct time at 12 noon and let it run for 12 hours, what time would the clock show at 12 midnight? \n A. 12:00 \n B. 12:30 \n C. 12:33 \n D. 12:36",
        "answer": "The correct answer is: D. 36. Reason: Since the clock runs 3 minutes fast per hour, in an hour it would show 63 minutes instead of 60 minutes. Therefore, in 12 hours it would show: 12 hours * (63 minutes/hour) = 756 minutes, which is equal to 12 hours and 36 minutes.",
        "values": "",
        "hints": "Hint: The clock runs 3 minutes fast per hour. So, in one hour under normal circumstances, where the clock should show 60 minutes, this clock will show 63 minutes. What will it show in 12 hours?"
